# jeopardy_buzzer
This is a mobile buzzer app for small games. It is designed to follow the jeopardy rules where people are locked out until the question is done being read.
This app is designed to be hosted on an EC2 Instance or by opening up port 3000 on your computer to other devices on the network. It can only support one game for now.

## To work on:
- Multiple games
- Making it look nicer
- More settings surrounding games
